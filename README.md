# National Parks Endangered Species Analysis - Introduction

This is my second python project on Github. I will perform data analysis on the conservation status of 25,000 endagered species found in a dataset from the National Parks Service.

Throughout this project, I will analyze, clean, and visualize data as well as pose questions and seek to answer them in a meaningful.

# Data Exploration

The first step in this project is to explore the data. In the data folder, you will find the endangered_species.csv file containing the information about the endangered species in different national parks. Open the data in your preferred data analysis tool (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, R, or Excel) and start exploring the dataset to familiarize yourself with the variables and their values.

# Data Cleaning

After exploring the data, you will likely find that some cleaning is necessary. This may include handling missing values, fixing data entry errors, or standardizing data formats. Document your data cleaning process and any decisions made along the way to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

# Data Analysis

Once the data is clean, it's time to dive into the analysis. Begin by asking questions and forming hypotheses about the factors that contribute to species endangerment. As you explore the data further, you may find trends or relationships that can help answer these questions. Be sure to document your findings and any supporting evidence.

# Data Visualization

Visualizing your data can help communicate your findings more effectively. Create plots and charts to illustrate the trends and relationships discovered during the analysis. Be sure to use appropriate visualization techniques and provide clear labels and titles for each plot.

# Conclusion

TODO: Summarize the findings of the analysis and discuss any implications for conservation efforts.
