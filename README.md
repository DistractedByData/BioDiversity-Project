# National Parks Species Analysis

This is my first python project on Github. My goal is to apply data analysis, particularly practicing with Pandas and Matplotlib, as well as exploratory data analysis and using statistics and probabalities. 

The dataset is provided by Codecademy, included in the [Data Analysis course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/data-analyst) I am taking - the dataset contains observations of 25,000 species originally sourced from the National Parks Service.

Throughout this project, I will spend time learning about the data. I will develop questions based on the data available, and explore the relationships between the various features. By the end of this project, I will have cleaned the data, explored the data, applied statistical tests, and visualized the data. 

Full analysis the Jupyter notbook titled [biodiversity.ipynb](https://github.com/SoManyDistractions/BioDiversity-Project/blob/main/Analysis/biodiversity.ipynb).
